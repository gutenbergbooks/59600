<p>When the boys were compelled to jump overboard, they could see that the
water was only about two feet deep, but they did not know whether they
could stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[Pg 722]</a></span> up against the fierce current. They found that they could,
although they had to move slowly to avoid being swept off their feet.
Harry's canoe was easily pushed off the rock on which it had run, and
the moment it was out of the way the other canoes were free. Each
canoeist seized the stern of his own canoe, and let it drag him down the
rest of the rapid, which fortunately was a short one. While performing
this feat the knees of the canoeists were scraped over the rocks, and
they received several bruises; but they thought it was impossible to get
into their canoes in swift water, and so had no choice except to float
down hanging on to the sterns of the canoes.</p>

<p>Reaching the smooth water, they swam and pushed the canoes before them
toward the shore. Here they found a great bank of sawdust that had
floated down the river from the mill at Magog, and it was so soft and
elastic that they determined to sleep on it that night instead of
sleeping in their canoes, since the sky was perfectly clear and there
was no danger of rain.</p>

<p>The canoes were hauled out on the bank, so that the stores could be
readily taken out of them. The canvas canoe did not seem to be in the
least injured either by the rock on which she had struck or by the
collision with the other canoes. Harry's canoe had sustained a little
damage where one of the planks had been ground against the rock on which
she had hung so long, but it was not enough to cause her to leak, and
the injuries of the other canoes were confined to their varnish.</p>

<p>"All the trouble," remarked Harry, "came from following too close after
one another. To-morrow, if we find any more rapids, we will keep the
canoes far enough apart, so that if one canoe runs aground, the others
can turn out for her."</p>

<p>"We could have got into the canoes easy enough if we had only thought
so," said Tom. "If I'd stood up on the rock and held the canoe alongside
of it, I could have stepped in without any difficulty."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you do it, then?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Because I didn't think of it, and because all the rest of you had
started to float down after your canoes."</p>

<p>"I noticed one thing about a rapid which if I was Commodore it would be
my duty to impress on your faithful but ignorant minds," said Joe. "When
you see a big ripple on the water, the rock that makes it isn't under
the ripple, but is about four or five feet higher up stream."</p>

<p>"That's Macgregor!" cried Harry; "but I'd forgotten it. To-morrow we'll
run our rapids in real scientific style."</p>

<p>"Provided there are any more rapids," suggested Tom.</p>

<p>"What did that Sherbrooke postmaster say about the Magog rapids?"
inquired Joe.</p>

<p>"Said there weren't any, except one or two which we could easily run,"
replied Harry.</p>

<p>"Then we've probably got through with the rapids," said Charley. "I'm
rather sorry, for it's good fun running them."</p>

<p>Supper was now over, and the canoeists, spreading their rubber blankets
on the sawdust, prepared to "turn in." They were very tired, and, lulled
by the sound of the rapids, soon dropped asleep.</p>

<p>The recent rains had dampened the sawdust to the depth of about two
inches, but below this it was dry and inflammable. A fire had been made
with which to cook supper, and the dampness of the sawdust had made the
boys so confident that the fire would not spread, that they had not
taken the trouble to put it out before going to sleep.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the damp sawdust on which the fire had been kindled
gradually became dry, and finally took fire. It burned very slowly on
the surface, but the dry sawdust immediately below burned like tinder.
About two hours after Harry had closed his eyes he was awakened from a
dream that he had upset a burning spirit-lamp over his legs. To his
horror he saw that the whole bank of sawdust was on fire. Smoke was
everywhere creeping up through the damp top layer, and at a little
distance from the canoes the smouldering fire had burst into roaring
flames.</p>

<p>Harry instantly called his comrades, and starting up, they rushed to the
canoes, threw their blankets and stores into them, and prepared to
launch them. They had not a moment to spare. The flames were close to
them, and were spreading every moment, and as they shoved the canoes
toward the water their feet repeatedly sank down through the ashes below
the surface, the flames springing up as they drew them back. It did not
take many minutes to get the canoes into the water and to embark, but as
the canoeists pushed out into the river, the part of the bank where they
had been sleeping burst into flames.</p>

<p>A light breeze had sprung up, which was just enough to fan the fire and
to carry it into an immense pile of dry drift-wood that lay on the shore
below the sawdust bank. The boys waited in the quiet eddy near the bank
and watched the progress of the fire. It licked up the drift-wood in a
very few moments, and then, roaring with exultation over the work it had
done, it swept into the forest. In half an hour's time a forest fire was
burning which threatened to make a terrible destruction of timber, and
the heat had grown so intense that the canoeists were compelled to drop
down the stream to avoid it.</p>

<p>Canoeing at night is always a ticklish business, but on a swift river,
full of rapids, as is the Magog, it is exceedingly dangerous. The fire
lighted the way for the fleet for a short distance, but before a
landing-place was reached a turn on the river shut out the light, and at
the same time the noise of a rapid close at hand was heard.</p>

<p>The boys had no desire to entangle themselves in unknown rapids in the
dark, and paddled at once for the shore opposite to that where the fire
was raging. They found when they reached it that it was a perpendicular
bank on which it was impossible to land. They floated down a short
distance, hoping to find a landing-spot, but none could be found. Then
they attempted to cross the stream to the other shore, hoping that the
fire would not spread in that direction. To their dismay they found that
they were already almost within the clutch of the rapid. The current had
become strong and swift, and it was evident before they had got half-way
across the river that nothing but the hardest paddling could keep them
from being drawn into the rapid. It was an occasion when everybody had
to look out for himself, and depend on his own paddles for safety. The
young canoeists struck out manfully. Harry was the first to reach the
shore, where he caught hold of the root of a tree and kept his canoe
stationary. Tom followed closely behind him, and Harry told him to catch
hold of the <i>Sunshine</i> until he could make the <i>Twilight</i>'s painter fast
to the root. Joe arrived a little later, for his canoe had run on a
rock, and for a few minutes he was in great danger of a capsize.</p>

<p>The three canoeists succeeded in tying up to the bank, where they
expected every moment to be joined by Charley. The minutes passed on,
but Charley did not appear. His comrades shouted for him, but there was
no answer. Indeed, the rapid made such a noise, now that they were close
upon it, that they could not have heard Charley's voice had he been a
few yards from them.</p>

<p>The fear that an accident had happened to Charley made the other boys
very uneasy. Joe cast his canoe loose, and paddled out into the river,
and nearly across it, looking for some signs of the <i>Midnight</i> and her
owner; but he came back unsuccessful, after having narrowly escaped
being carried down the rapid. There could no longer be any doubt that
the current had swept the <i>Midnight</i> away, and that Charley had been
compelled to make the hazardous and almost hopeless attempt of running
the rapid in the dark.</p>

<p>As soon as Joe returned, Harry said that he would paddle out into the
middle of the river, where Charley was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[Pg 723]</a></span> last seen, and would let his
canoe drift down the rapid, but Tom and Joe insisted that he should do
no such thing. Said Joe: "Either Charley is drowned or he isn't. If he
isn't drowned, he is somewhere at the foot of the rapid, where we'll
find him as soon as it gets light. If he is drowned, it won't do him any
good for another of us to get drowned."</p>

<p>"Joe is right," said Tom. "We must stay here until daylight."</p>

<p>"And meanwhile Charley may be drowned!" exclaimed Harry.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he is," replied Tom. "He's the best canoeist of any of
us, and he is too good a sailor to get frightened. Then he is very
cautious, and I'll bet that the first thing he did when he found himself
in the rapid was to buckle his life-belt round him."</p>

<p>"If he did that it wouldn't hurt him if he were capsized."</p>

<p>"Not if the rapid is like those we've run, and the chances are that it
is. I feel sure that Charley has got through it all right, and without
losing his canoe. We'll find him waiting for us in the morning."</p>

<p>What Tom said seemed so reasonable that Harry gave up his wild idea of
running the rapid, and agreed to wait until daylight. It was already
nearly one o'clock, and at that time of year the day began to dawn by
half past three. There was no opportunity for the boys to sleep, but
they occasionally nodded as they sat in their canoes. About two o'clock
Harry poked Tom with his paddle, and in a low voice called his attention
to the crackling of the twigs in the woods a short distance from the
bank. Something was evidently making its way through the forest, and
coming nearer every minute to the canoes. The boys grasped their
pistols, and anxiously waited. They remembered that there were bears in
the woods, and they fully believed that one was on its way down to the
water. "Don't fire," whispered Harry, "till I give the word;" but while
he was speaking a dark form parted the underbrush on the bank above
them, and came out into full view.</p>

<h2><a name="CORALS" id="CORALS">CORALS.</a></h2>

<h3>BY SARAH COOPER.</h3>

<p>Most boys and girls like corals. They are so common and easily obtained
that I hope each of you will lay aside your reading just here, and hunt
up a piece, no matter how small, that we may examine it carefully, and
see what we can find out about it. You must find, however, a piece of
the natural coral, just as it was brought up out of the sea, and not an
elegant and polished piece such as is made into ear-rings and brooches
and long strings of beads to adorn the necks of ladies and little folk.</p>

<p>What makes this bit of natural coral so rough? The first glance will
convince you that those curious pits and little cups on the surface mean
something; and when we remember that all the corals which reach us are
the skeletons of former living animals, they interest us at once.</p>

<p>Few of us, perhaps, will ever be so fortunate as to see living corals,
since they grow principally in the deep water of warm oceans. The higher
the temperature, the greater the variety and profusion of the coral.
During life the skeleton is covered with soft flesh, the surface of
which is thickly studded with star-like animals called polyps. In this
way millions of polyps are sometimes clustered together in one
community. As they wave their delicate tentacles of white, green, or
rose color, they are said to be very beautiful, especially if seen in
the bright sunlight through water that is clear and still.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/ill_003.jpg" width="400" height="396" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Branching Coral Alive, with Polyps Expanded</span>.</span>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 1 is shown a piece of living coral with the polyps expanded. The
flesh has been removed from the upper branch on the left that we may see
the skeleton. Let us suppose that the specimens we have selected for
study are of this kind. Each of the tiny cups on the surface was once
the frame-work of a separate polyp, and we shall find that its interior
is divided by a number of partitions which do not quite reach the
centre. Look into the cups with your microscopes,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and you will find
them very beautiful. One set of partition-walls reaches almost to the
centre, and between these walls are shorter ones. These give us a clew
to the kind of animal that has lived here, and they will at once remind
you of the partitions in the sea-anemone, as shown in Fig. 2 in the
article on "Sea-Anemones," published in <span class="smcap">Young People</span> No. 143. Indeed,
the whole structure of a coral polyp is similar to that of an anemone,
and we can now easily imagine the stomach of the polyp hanging down in
the opening left between those delicate partitions. Coral polyps differ
from sea-anemones, however, in three important ways&mdash;they have hard
skeletons, they can not move about, and they usually grow in clusters.</p>

<p>When young, coral polyps are little jelly-like animals which swim about
in the water. After they have chosen a resting-place, and the stomach
and tentacles have grown, hard particles of lime, which they have drawn
in from the sea-water, settle in their flesh to form a circular cup as
well as the partitions inside. In this way the polyps soon acquire a
solid frame, the soft parts being the stomach, the fringe of tentacles,
and the fleshy mass covering the skeleton and the internal partitions.
They can draw the tentacles entirely within the body, as the anemone
does. Like the anemone they also have lasso-cells for capturing their
food.</p>

<p>Should it be a branching coral whose history we are tracing, it will now
begin to bud from the sides. The buds will grow into branches, throwing
out other buds, somewhat as plants do, until we have an elegantly
branching colony. Each bud is a new polyp, and remains attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[Pg 724]</a></span> the
branch from which it sprang. Although the polyps in such a community
have separate mouths and stomachs, there is a close connection between
them, and a free circulation of fluids through the soft flesh.</p>

<p>As in other families one generation passes away and another takes its
place, so in large branches of coral the lower and older portions may be
dead, and living polyps will be found only at the ends of the branches.
Corals seem to be delicate creatures, as they will not flourish under
adverse circumstances. They require water of a certain depth, and they
die immediately if exposed to the sun or to cold weather.</p>

<p>Besides increasing by budding, corals increase rapidly by eggs. Their
eggs are pear-shaped, transparent bodies, covered with cilia, which are
in constant motion, and which row the jelly-like lumps through the
water. The parents, you remember, are firmly rooted to some object, but
their little ones are gifted for a time with the power of motion. They
may well enjoy the privilege while it lasts, for it is their only chance
of exploring their ocean home. Presently they must settle down like
other sedate corals. But it is in this manner that the young polyps are
distributed through the ocean instead of growing in a crowded colony
around the parent.</p>

<p>You will often hear coral spoken of as having been built by an insect,
and you will see at once that this is far from correct. Coral polyps are
very different from insects, and their skeletons grow, much as ours do,
inside of the animal; so we can not say they have been built. All such
animals as coral polyps, which have the mouth in the centre, with other
parts radiating from it, are called "Radiates."</p>

<p>Besides these branching corals which resemble trees and shrubs, some
grow in solid masses without sending off branches. Others assume the
shape of graceful vases; all of these are gayly decked with star-like
polyps of varied colors. Does it not seem to you as if the ocean was one
vast store-house of beautiful things?</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/ill_004.jpg" width="400" height="184" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 2.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mushroom Coral</span>.</span>
</div>

<p>The mushroom coral (Fig. 2) looks indeed like a large mushroom, although
you will notice that the leaflets are on the upper surface instead of
being underneath, as they are in the vegetable mushroom. This coral is
the skeleton of one huge polyp, and we see the depression in the centre
corresponding to the little cups on most other corals.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 192px;">
<img src="images/ill_005.jpg" width="192" height="300" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 3&mdash;<span class="smcap">Organ-pipe Coral</span>.</span>
</div>

<p>The organ-pipe coral consists of lovely crimson tubes standing upright,
and connected at short distances by thin flat plates, which give it the
appearance of being several stories in height. These plates may be
distinctly seen in Fig. 3. When alive, a little polyp protrudes from the
top of each tube, and being of a bright purple color, it makes a

<span class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fragment of Red Coral with Polyps</span>.</span>
</div>

<p>Red coral, which is used for jewelry, grows in a bushy form on rocks at
the bottom of the Mediterranean and Red Seas. The fleshy mass of this
coral is colored red by the numerous red spicules it contains, while the
polyps are pure white. The whole resembles a pretty red shrub spotted
over with sparkling white flowers. The spicules in the centre of the
branches form a solid stem, which takes a fine polish. Underneath the
flesh the surface of the coral is marked with deep grooves, which are
canals for the circulation of water. These grooves are shown at both
ends of the branch in Fig. 4. They are always removed in polishing.</p>

<p>Red coral is generally obtained by fishermen, who drop into the water
heavy wooden crosses to which strong nets are attached. As the boat
moves slowly forward, the crosses are raised and lowered to break off
the coral branches. The apparatus is then lifted from the water, and the
fragments of coral which have become entangled in the net are carefully
removed. There are many shops in Italy where the coral is polished and
cut into various ornaments. Delicate rose-colored corals are considered
very choice and elegant, but the natives of India prefer blood-red ones,
which contrast finely with their dark rich complexions. Corals are their
favorite ornaments, and large quantities are imported every year.</p>

<h2><a name="DOWN_CELLAR" id="DOWN_CELLAR">DOWN CELLAR.</a></h2>

<h3>BY JIMMY BROWN.</h3>

<p>We have had a dreadful time at our house, and I have done very wrong.
Oh, I always admit it when I've done wrong. There's nothing meaner than
to pretend that you haven't done wrong when everybody knows you have. I
didn't mean anything by it, though, and Sue ought to have stood by me,
when I did it all on her account, and just because I pitied her, if she
was my own sister, and it was more her fault, I really think, than it
was mine.</p>

<p>Mr. Withers is Sue's new young man, as I have told you already. He comes
to see her every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evening, and Mr. Travers
comes all the other evenings, and Mr. Martin is liable to come any time,
and generally does&mdash;that is, if he doesn't have the rheumatism. Though
he hasn't but one real leg, he has twice as much rheumatism as father,
with all his legs, and there is something very queer about it; and if I
was he, I'd get a leg of something better than cork, and perhaps he'd
have less pain in it.</p>

<p>It all happened last Tuesday night. Just as it was getting dark, and Sue
was expecting Mr. Travers every minute, who should come in but Mr.
Martin! Now Mr. Martin is such an old acquaintance, and father thinks so
much of him, that Sue had to ask him in, though she didn't want him to
meet Mr. Travers. So when she heard somebody open the front gate, she
said, "Oh, Mr. Martin I'm so thirsty and the servant has gone out, and
you know just where the milk is for you went down cellar to get some the
last time you were here do you think you would mind getting some for
me?" Mr. Martin had often gone down cellar to help himself to milk, and
I don't see what makes him so fond of it, so he said, "Certainly with
great pleasure," and started down the cellar stairs.</p>

<p>It wasn't Mr. Travers, but Mr. Withers, who had come on the wrong night.
He had not much more than got into the parlor when Sue came rushing out
to me, for I was swinging in the hammock on the front piazza, and said,
"My goodness gracious Jimmy what shall I do here's Mr. Withers and Mr.
Travers will be here in a few minutes and there's Mr. Martin down cellar
and I feel as if I should fly what shall I do?"</p>

<p>I was real sorry for her, and thought I'd help her, for girls are not
like us. They never know what to do when they are in a scrape, and they
are full of absence of mind when they ought to have lots of presence of
mind. So I said: "I'll fix it for you, Sue. Just leave it all to me. You
stay here and meet Mr. Travers, who is just coming around the corner,
and I'll manage Mr. Withers." Sue said, "You darling little fellow there
don't muss my hair"; and I went in, and said to Mr. Withers, in an
awfully mysterious way, "Mr. Withers, I hear a noise in the cellar.
Don't tell Sue, for she's dreadfully nervous. Won't you go down and see
what it is?" Of course I knew it was Mr. Martin who was making the
noise, though I didn't say so.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's nothing but rats, Jimmy," said he, "or else the cat, or maybe
it's the cook."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," said I. "If I was you, I'd go and see into it. Sue
thinks you're awfully brave."</p>

<p>Well, after a little more talk, Mr. Withers said he'd go, and I showed
him the cellar door, and got him started down the stairs, and then I
locked the door, and went back to the hammock, and Sue and Mr. Travers
they sat in the front parlor.</p>

<span class="caption">"THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE BOTH BURGLARS."</span>
</div>

<p>Pretty soon I heard a heavy crash down cellar, as if something heavy had
dropped, and then there was such a yelling and howling, just as if the
cellar was full of murderers. Mr. Travers jumped up, and was starting
for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[Pg 726]</a></span> cellar, when Sue fainted away, and hung tight to him, and
wouldn't let him go.</p>

<p>I staid in the hammock, and wouldn't have left it if father hadn't come
down-stairs, but when I saw him going down cellar, I went after him to
see what could possibly be the matter.</p>

<p>Father had a candle in one hand and a big club in another. You ought to
have been there to see Mr. Martin and Mr. Withers. One of them had run
against the other in the dark, and they thought they were both burglars.
So they got hold of each other, and fell over the milk pans and upset
the soap barrel, and then rolled round the cellar floor, holding on to
each other, and yelling help murder thieves, and when we found them,
they were both in the ash bin, and the ashes were choking them.</p>

<p>Father would have pounded them with the club if I hadn't told him who
they were. He was awfully astonished, and though he wouldn't say
anything to hurt Mr. Martin's feelings, he didn't seem to care much for
mine or Mr. Withers's, and when Mr. Travers finally came down, father
told him that he was a nice young man, and that the whole house might
have been murdered by burglars while he was enjoying himself in the
front parlor.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin went home after he got a little of the milk and soap and
ashes and things off of him, but he was too angry to speak. Mr. Withers
said he would never enter the house again, and Mr. Travers didn't even
wait to speak to Sue, he was in such a rage with Mr. Withers. After they
were all gone, Sue told father that it was all my fault, and father said
he would attend to my case in the morning; only, when the morning came,
he told me not to do it again, and that was all.</p>

<p>I admit that I did do wrong, but I didn't mean it, and my only desire
was to help my dear sister. You won't catch me helping her again very
soon.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LONG_STRIKE" id="THE_LONG_STRIKE">THE LONG STRIKE.</a></h2>

<h3>BY JULIA K. HILDRETH.</h3>

<p>All along the banks of the Connecticut River are little towns consisting
almost wholly of great cotton factories run by water power or steam, and
the cottages of those who labor in them. Windham is one of these towns,
and though perhaps you might not find it on the map, for it is a very
small place, it turns out thousands of yards of muslin and cotton every
year. All around the tall factory buildings are grouped the little red
and white dwellings of the weavers, like chickens around their mother
hen.</p>

<p>Usually these small houses are empty during working hours. All day long
the hum and clatter of machinery shake the walls, and dense volumes of
smoke pour from the tall chimneys.</p>

<p>But one morning everything was changed. The doors of the factories were
closed; no smoke came from the chimneys, and no sound of machinery from
the buildings. Around the cottages men stood in groups, with angry
faces, scowling and talking in low tones. Presently the sound of a drum
was heard. At this the men separated, and forming themselves into a
line, marched off.</p>

<p>About a quarter of a mile from the village was an open field, where a
tent had been erected for the accommodation of travelling lecturers, who
were in the habit of stopping at Windham in the summer-time.</p>

<p>To this tent the men were going when Nelly Austin first saw them. Nelly
lived all alone with her mother in a small house near the tent. She knew
very little of factories or factory life, for she seldom went to the
village, and had no companions living there. So when this crowd of men,
with a boy beating a drum before them, came marching along the road,
Nelly was astonished, and ran in the house to tell her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Austin was sitting by the window sewing, and grew very white when
Nelly spoke.</p>

<p>"Mamma," cried Nelly, "look out of the window at that big army of men!
They are going into the tent." As Nelly approached her mother she saw
that there were tears in her eyes. "Are you frightened, mamma?" she
inquired. "Do you think they will hurt us?"</p>

<p>"No, Nelly," answered Mrs. Austin; "they are only men from Windham. They
are dissatisfied with something the owners of the factories have done,
and so have come to the tent to talk it over. They do not want to work
until they have their own way. That is what is called 'striking.'"</p>

<p>"Well, then, mamma," inquired Nelly, "if they only mean to talk, why do
you feel so badly and cry?"</p>

<p>"Because, dear, years ago, when you were a baby, there was a strike at
Windham that ended in a terrible fight, and your papa, who owned one of
the factories, was killed and our house burned."</p>

<p>"How dreadful!" said Nelly. "I am so sorry!" Then she kissed her mother
softly, and with a very sober face went to the door and peeped out.</p>

<p>The orchard wall ran across one side of the inclosure where the tent was
placed. She ran to the wall, and climbing up on top, peeped down upon
the assembled workmen. They did not look at all blood-thirsty. Some were
even laughing; most of them had their pipes in their mouths, smoking. At
a desk on one side of the room stood a man who was talking loudly to
those around him. Every now and then Nelly heard the words "injustice,"
"never give up," "masters and men," but she could make nothing of them.</p>

<p>Week after week the workmen came to the tent, until Nelly grew so
accustomed to their meetings that she scarcely noticed them. But one
day, about ten weeks after their first meeting, when the strikers were
assembled under the tent, they talked so loudly and made so much noise
that Nelly clambered upon the orchard wall again, wondering what was
going to happen. She noticed that there was no pleasant laughing and
talking, as there had been at first; instead of which, the men seemed to
Nelly to be scolding and shaking their fists at one another. She tried
very hard to make out what they were saying, but as they all spoke at
once, she soon found that impossible. But still she sat perched under
the apple-tree, until at last all but two of their number got up and
went away. These two kept their seats until the rest had disappeared
down the road. Then they came just outside of the tent and stood close
to Nelly without observing her.</p>

<p>"I will not bear it another day," said one, looking very miserable and
angry. "My wife and young ones are starving. Can I stand by and see
that? And yet you tell me to have patience!"</p>

<p>"It's all Mr. Willard's fault, Bill," said the other, more quietly. "If
he would give in, all the other owners would follow his example. They
always do."</p>

<p>"Well, then," answered Bill, shaking his fist, "he <i>shall</i>, if I have to
kill him myself."</p>

<p>"Go home, Bill," said the other, in a warning voice, "and don't talk
nonsense. It will all come right in time."</p>

<p>Then he turned away, and left Bill alone, scowling and muttering, while
Nelly sat on the wall trembling with fear lest she might be discovered.</p>

<p>When Bill thought himself alone, he drew out a heavy pistol from his
pocket, and Nelly saw him load it and thrust it into the breast of his
red shirt. He then went back to the tent, and throwing himself upon one
of the benches, appeared to fall asleep.</p>

<p>Nelly's fright increased. "I wonder," she said to herself, "if he really
means to kill old Mr. Willard?" Then she determined to be very brave.
What was best to do she could not tell. Finally she said to herself,
"I'll just stay where I am and watch."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">[Pg 727]</a></span></p>

<p>Nelly sat with her eyes fixed on Bill for a long time, but he did not
stir until the clock in the Windham church struck six; then he stood up,
and after looking all around, crossed the road and climbed the wall that
inclosed Mr. Willard's wood.</p>

<p>"There!" said Nelly; "now I <i>know</i> he means to shoot Mr. Willard."</p>

<p>Nelly and every one living near knew that Mr. Willard, the richest
factory owner in Windham, walked through these woods alone every
evening, about half past six, to the post-office. Mr. Willard chose this
way to the village, because it was the shortest and pleasantest.</p>

<p>When Nelly saw Bill climb the wall, she knew it must be for the purpose
of meeting Mr. Willard, as the man's home was quite in an opposite
direction; so she jumped down and followed him quickly. As she reached
the upper stone of the wall inclosing the wood, she caught a glimpse of
him hurrying toward the road that led to the post-office. But by the
time she had reached the ground he was gone. So Nelly flew along without
even glancing at the pretty golden-rod and squawberries that gleamed
yellow and red between the trees.</p>

<p>At last Nelly gained the wide road, and looked around. Something red
lying upon the ground attracted her attention. After a moment she
perceived that it was Bill's red shirt, and that Bill himself was
stretched upon the ground behind a large sycamore-tree, and he was
almost hidden in the long grass and weeds.</p>

<p>Nelly stood in the path some time, fearing to pass him, he looked so
angry and wicked. But she had determined to try and see Mr. Willard
before Bill, and so perhaps save his life. At last she heard something
that sounded like a footstep. This made her forget her dread of Bill,
and she sprang past his hiding-place like a frightened hare, and never
stopped until she reached a small rustic gate that separated the woods
from the smooth green lawn surrounding Mr. Willard's home.</p>

<p>From where she stood Nelly could see the wide porch of the brown-stone
house, and presently Mr. Willard himself appeared hurrying across the
grass. When his hand was on the gate, Nelly drew back, for she felt very
timid at what she was about to do.</p>

<p>When Mr. Willard saw Nelly, he put on his gold-rimmed eyeglass and
examined her closely, as though astonished at seeing such a small girl
all alone in the woods, with a very worried expression in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "who are you, little girl?"</p>

<p>"Nelly Austin," she answered, without moving.</p>

<p>"Austin! Austin!" repeated Mr. Willard. "Are you the daughter of Mr.
James Austin that was killed by the mob at Windham some years ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Nelly, "and I want to tell you something."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mr. Willard, patting her on the head. "I am listening.
But speak quickly, for it is late, and I must post my letters before the
mail goes out."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Willard," cried Nelly, excitedly seizing his hand and pulling
him toward the gate, "don't go through the woods to the post-office
to-night!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" questioned the old gentleman in surprise.</p>

<p>"Because there's a dreadful man waiting behind the sycamore-tree to kill
you with a big pistol, just as they did my poor father."</p>

<p>"How did you learn this, Nelly?" asked Mr. Willard, wonderingly, and
looking closely at her.</p>

<p>Then Nelly related all she had seen and heard from her hiding-place upon
the orchard wall.</p>

<p>Mr. Willard stood in silence for some moments after Nelly had finished
her story; then he lifted her upon his arm, and said:</p>

<p>"You are a good kind girl, little Nelly, and I thank you. Do you know
that a man values his life more than anything else he possesses, and
that you have saved mine? Now, Nelly, ask me for something you would
like to have for yourself. No matter what it is, you shall have it.
Remember, I am a very rich man."</p>

<p>"Would you really give me anything I ask for?" said Nelly, looking
inquiringly into Mr. Willard's face.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, anything in my power. Now would you like a carriage with
two beautiful little cream-colored ponies to drive yourself? Or what
would you like? Speak out, Nelly, and don't be afraid."</p>

<p>"No," said Nelly, shaking her head. "Ponies would be very nice. But
that's not it. What I want would cost ever so much more, I suppose. I
want you," said she, hesitatingly, while she stroked his white beard
softly with one hand, "to please give in to the poor people at Windham."</p>

<p>"What a strange child!" said Mr. Willard, slowly. "And is that all,
Nelly?"</p>

<p>"Not quite," answered Nelly. "There's something more that I feel bad
about."</p>

<p>"Speak, dear, what is it?"</p>

<p>"You know the wicked man in the woods waiting to kill you? Well, he said
his wife and babies were starving. Please don't put him in prison."</p>

<p>"But, Nelly," said Mr. Willard, very kindly, "you know this man has done
very wrong. It is he and others like him who stir up discontent among
the factory people and cause these terrible 'strikes,' which only end in
keeping them idle for weeks, until they grow so miserable that dreadful
crimes are committed."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I want you to forgive them. Some people say they are very
reasonable in what they want this time, and you can do it just this
once. They are so poor and wretched and hungry. Please, please do!"</p>

<p>Mr. Willard kissed her. "Well, Nelly," he said, "I promise. The
work-people shall have their own way, and Bill shall go unpunished. Now
what shall I give you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, thank you," answered Nelly, slipping from his arms. "I must go
home, for mamma doesn't know where I am. Good-by, Mr. Willard; I thank
you ever so much for your promise."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Nelly. Now kiss me, and take care of yourself until I see you
again."</p>

<p>Next morning when the factory bells rang out, it was known all over
Windham that the working people were to go to work on their own terms.
Mr. Willard had given in. Once more the doors were flung open, black
smoke rushed from the chimneys, the machinery hummed and buzzed, and
busy, cheerful forms could be seen hurrying to and fro.</p>

<p>But a day or two later a meeting of the factory people was called, and
then the story was told that Mr. Willard had yielded, not to the demands
of Bill and his fellows, but to the prayer of a little girl who had
forgiven the men who murdered her father, and who could not be content
to see them suffer.</p>

<p>Not long after, Mr. Willard called on Nelly's mother, and sat talking
with her for a long while. As he took his leave he put a folded paper in
Mrs. Austin's hand, telling her there was something for Nelly. After he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[Pg 728]</a></span>
was gone Mrs. Austin opened the paper and called Nelly to her.</p>

<p>"This," said she, "is what is called a deed, and Mr. Willard has given
you the house we live in and the woods you love so much."</p>

<p>"For my own?" cried Nelly, opening her eyes very wide.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," answered her mother.</p>

<p>"And the rabbits and squirrels and birds and everything in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, all of them."</p>

<p>I can not tell you all that Nelly said, or how much happiness there was
in the little cottage. After this Nelly and Mr. Willard became close
friends. He called her his "Wood Fairy," and they could be seen almost
every day wandering hand in hand through Nelly's wood.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_BILLY_WENT_UP_IN_THE_WORLD" id="HOW_BILLY_WENT_UP_IN_THE_WORLD">HOW BILLY WENT UP IN THE WORLD.</a></h2>

<h3>BY ANNETTE NOBLE.</h3>

<h3>Part III.</h3>

<p>One day it happened that the tailor had not been home for twenty-four
hours. Billy's coming into his family had made Peter very negligent.
When he failed to bring food for the old woman and child, he assured
himself that most likely Billy would get some. Peter was sure he ought
to do that much for the shelter of a comfortable home. So every week the
tailor drank more and staid away from that home longer; but Billy,
wholly absorbed in his own plans, hardly noticed the fact, and Ben never
complained of anything that could be endured. As long as the cow had
fresh grass, they had milk and did not suffer. If it happened that Billy
heard granny ask for meat, he got it for her; if not, she went without
and forgot it from one meal-time to another. Indeed, she forgot
everything but her Bible.</p>

<p>Well, as I have just said, Peter had not been home for twenty-four
hours. Sunset came, and Billy did not return. The minstrel troupe were
getting ready to leave town, and he was probably with them. The cow did
not come home as she had often been accustomed to do of her own accord.</p>

<p>All these non-appearances made Ben very uneasy. He laid the table with
empty dishes, and then watched on the door-steps. The stars came out and
winked at him; the crickets made lonesome music. Presently granny
tottered across the room, took up an empty cup, and shook her head
musingly.</p>

<p>"Was the tea strong to-night, dearie?" she asked. "It seems as if it
must have been poor stuff, I feel so weak."</p>

<p>"You have not had any, granny, but I guess we will s-soo-" began Ben,
and then stopped. It did not seem worth while to stutter long over a
thing so doubtful. But when the old Clock struck eight, Billy took his
torn hat from the peg behind the door and said, "I am going after
Brownie; she must have got into Mr. Ellery's pasture."</p>

<p>"Yes, child. The green pastures and still waters," answered the old
woman. "And there is the Shepherd, you know. I shall not want."</p>

<p>"There isn't any shepherd there, and we must go after our own cow when
she strays away, granny."</p>

<p>Ben shut the door gently then, and went down under the sunflowers along
the road and over a narrow bridge, stopping to look into the rapid
stream where the cattle came to drink at noon-time. Yes, sly Brownie was
in the neighbor's pasture; but she took little Ben's grave rebuke very
meekly, as became a good cow, and started away home. She reached the
bridge and clattered over it, her hoofs shaking the unsteady planks.</p>

<p>As soon as he saw her headed in the right direction, Ben lingered to
look longingly up the main road, for it was not so dark that he could
not see if any one should happen to be coming down that road. He was
just turning to go on, when he discovered a man in the distance. As Ben
saw him walking first in the dusty road, then in the dewy may-weed of
the border, now here, now there, he sped briskly toward him to act as a
walking-stick. How often he had performed this sad duty before! Yet
there was no hesitation or delay in the way he sprang forward to help
the unhappy father who had done so little for his child.</p>

<p>"Humph! I should think you had better be on hand, leaving poor fellow to
find his way home all 'lone this time night."</p>

<p>Ben did not answer. He had all he could do to keep his small feet out
from under Peter's great boots, and to keep both himself and his unhappy
parent from falling to the ground. At the bridge they made more noise
than even the cow had made in crossing. The old planks creaked and
rattled, while Peter lurched from one side to another.</p>

<p>"Take care, father! See, oh, s-s-see!" stuttered Ben. "You go too near
the edge!"</p>

<p>The shrill warning came too late. Peter staggered, pitched, and reeled
over into the brown water. One hand vainly snatching at Ben only tore
the shabby straw hat off his head. The poor child gave a long, loud
shriek for help. Fear loosened his stammering tongue, and the cry,
"Father will drown! Come, oh, come!" rang out wildly over the fields.
Meanwhile, by kneeling, he had seized the drunkard's coat, and was able
to hold him at least a moment.</p>

<p>It seemed an hour to Ben. Peter struggled madly, and flung both arms
around the frail boy to draw him recklessly down with him to death. Over
he went, without resistance, and the leaping, sparkling stream that was
so beautiful by day swept over them both. The stars twinkled overhead
and the crickets chirruped in the crisp grass, and at that very moment
Brownie was softly lowing at the little red cottage door. Granny waked
up and called out in the silence and shadow, "Bring the good Book,
Bennie, then we will go to rest."</p>

<p>Two hours later Billy came gayly whistling home and found the cottage
dark, the fire out, and the poor old woman shivering, troubled to
understand the strange stillness around her and her own discomfort. He
lit a candle and looked on the lounge, expecting to find little Ben
curled up there asleep, but the kitten, mewing pitifully when he
disturbed her, was there all alone.</p>

<p>"Where can he be, gran&mdash;" The words were arrested on Billy's lips.
Farmer Ellery entered the room and motioned to him to keep still. A
woman who followed him led granny tenderly into the next room, while
outside the door Billy heard muffled voices and many footsteps.</p>

<p>A moment later how his blood seemed to freeze with horror! The door
opened, and sad-faced men brought in, on a plank torn from the old
bridge, Peter, the tailor, dead. His pallid face gleamed through the
matted hair, the water dripped from his clothing, and clutched tightly
to his breast was poor little Ben. The child's soft locks streaming back
showed the sweet face that looked to Billy like an angel's, so pure was
it now. The patient little helper! Billy burst into tears. He forgot the
stuttering, the baby pinafore, the copper-toed shoes that used to make
Ben so funny. He all at once remembered how he gave himself so lovingly
to everybody's service&mdash;to his, to granny's, to the miserable father's,
even unto death. It seemed as if Billy must get him back, if only to
tell him how much he loved him. But that could not be ever again.</p>

<p>Farmer Ellery and the other kind neighbors made every effort to restore
the two to consciousness, but all was of no avail. They could only keep
the sad condition of things from the poor old woman until morning, and
then vie with one another in bringing her comforts.</p>

<p>The next few days were very strange ones to Billy. He never forgot an
hour of that morning when he sat on the door-step in the warm sunshine,
and peeped every now and then into the cottage, where, on the old
lounge, made white with snowy linen, was a child, strewn from head to
foot with apple-blossoms.</p>

<p>"He was not great, or handsome, or very smart," thought Billy, "but he
will be missed, for he was good, and he loved everybody. He was always
ready and willing to help, or to do, or to suffer. He was worth twice as
much as I am. Nothing is left for me but granny. I'll have to make up to
her the loss of both of them."</p>

<p>Suddenly there came into Billy's mind the thought of his chosen
occupation. Was he not to start out as a minstrel that very week?</p>

<p>I doubt if Billy had ever thought so much in all his life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[Pg 731]</a></span> before as he
did in the days that lay between the time when little Ben was brought
home so cold and white, and the funeral, when the kind neighbors buried
him away out of sight under the green sod. He seemed to be taking a new
view of life altogether. He could not have told the reason why, but the
idea of starting off with the minstrel troup seemed to lose its
fascination. He would have to leave that little green mound behind him,
and he did not want to do it.</p>

<p>It was two days after the funeral when, as Farmer Ellery was at work in
his field, there appeared quite unexpectedly a red head over the fence
near him, and then a boy with a very earnest face.</p>

<p>"Good-day, Billy. Going to leave us, I hear."</p>

<p>"No, sir. I have come to say I want to make a man of myself by being
just a hard-working boy, if you will show me how. And could I work for
enough to keep an old lady, do you think? I am going to keep her,
anyhow. The town shan't have granny. I am sorry I refused your offer.
That minstrel nonsense is no go for me."</p>

<p>Billy's face grew as red as his hair, but he went on in a minute:</p>

<p>"Her Book tells what a fellow ought to be, you know, and I think I had
better get into being something worth while. If I turn short around,
maybe I can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Make the most of yourself, with the help of God."</p>

<p>"That is it exactly."</p>

<p>"Come over the fence. Take a hoe and begin," said Farmer Ellery.</p>

<p>William Knox attended the last fair in Langham. He did not go up in a
balloon, but his cattle and his farm produce took first prizes. If it
had been becoming for a committee to decide what farmer was universally
beloved and respected, in whose honor the community fully believed,
perhaps there would have been another prize offered to William. If so,
his face would again have been redder than his hair, for the best men
are always modest.</p>

<h2><a name="TOM_FAIRWEATHERS_VOYAGE_UP_THE_TIGRIS" id="TOM_FAIRWEATHERS_VOYAGE_UP_THE_TIGRIS">TOM FAIRWEATHER'S VOYAGE UP THE TIGRIS.</a></h2>

<h3>BY LIEUTENANT E.&nbsp;W. STURDY.</h3>

<p>The <i>Blosse Lynch</i> is the largest boat on the Tigris, being built
somewhat on the model of the American river steamers, and on the <i>Blosse
Lynch</i> Tom Fairweather was embarked on a trip from Bassorah to Bagdad.</p>

<p>Bagdad, the City of the Caliphs, is five hundred miles from Bassorah,
first up the Shatt-el-Arab, and then against the swift current of the
Tigris, which runs at the rate of five miles an hour.</p>

<p>This voyage generally lasts three days, but sometimes, when the river is
low and the nights dark, it is impossible to steam by night at all, or
to go fast even by day. But Tom seemed born to good fortune and the fair
weather which his name bespoke. The steamer sped on her way favored in
all respects.</p>

<p>Tom's father had been to Bagdad before, and did not care to go again, so
Tom was put under the charge of Lieutenant Jollytarre, who had decided
to make the trip, although he, too, had made it already.</p>

<p>Such a motley throng on deck! There were keen-eyed swarthy Arabs of the
desert, and black-eyed, russet-hued Arabs of the Gulf (the Persian Gulf,
be it understood); there were Mussulmans from India on a pilgrimage to
Kerbela; Jews of Bagdad returning to their homes after a business visit
to Bassorah; there were Christians of Bagdad and Christians of Mosul. To
be sure, these latter looked as unlike the ordinary Christian of Tom's
acquaintance as possible, in their flowing robes and bright colors. But
then Christianity and trousers and frock-coats are not altogether
inseparable. Besides, there were Arab women, closely veiled, squatted
about the deck. Sometimes the veils fell, and displayed the adornment of
rings in the noses of these fair Arabians, blue lines elegantly tattooed
on their chins and foreheads and across their lips.</p>

<p>You may fancy that it was a source of endless amusement to Tom to
observe these different groups. Orientals are a tranquil set, and the
quaint figures about the deck of the steamer changed their positions but
seldom throughout the day; they smoked their caldeoous and drank their
coffee seated on carpets and mats, and only stirred at the hour of
prayer.</p>

<p>"Ain't it queer to see them saying their prayers right out before
everybody?" commented Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," agreed the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>Presently they began to approach Kumah.</p>

<p>"What's this other river?" demanded Tom.</p>

<p>"This is the junction of the Euphrates and Tigris, fifty miles above
Bassorah."</p>

<p>"Why, isn't this the Garden of Eden? I think my father told me that the
Garden of Eden was at Kumah."</p>

<p>"Well, he was right." Here Mr. Jollytarre hailed an Arab who had just
come on board to peddle his wares, consisting of curiosities and relics.</p>

<p>The Arab stood in front of Tom, gravely offering him a small branch of a
tree. His English was so bad, however, that Tom was forced to turn to
Mr. Jollytarre for an interpretation.</p>

<p>"He says that is a branch from the original tree which bore the
forbidden fruit."</p>

<p>"Good gracious, you don't say so!" And Tom forthwith purchased the
branch, paying two or three prices for it, of course.</p>

<p>Then the peddler jumped ashore, and they left Kumah behind them.</p>

<p>Afterward, for hours and hours a monotonous stretch of lowlands was the
only landscape. The river-banks were so low that the wash from the
steamer went over and watered the grass. Here and there were rice fields
cultivated by the Arabs, and where the land was drier green corn waved,
but not a tree broke the dead level of the landscape.</p>

<p>"What are those?" cried Tom, pointing to some animals playing among the
reeds. "Oh yes, I see now&mdash;pigs; wild pigs, I suppose? And those birds
are pelicans, are they not&mdash;there, in those pools? How snowy white they
are!"</p>

<p>"I was a youngster when I made this trip before," said the Lieutenant.
"It was my first cruise. I shall never forget shooting at a lion and two
lionesses which had climbed to the top of a bank, where they lay high
and dry. I hit the lion at the first shot, whereupon he plunged and
reared, and then charged desperately in the direction of the steamer. At
the second shot he rolled over dead into the water. But he showed fight,
I tell you, and the fury of the three animals was something to be
remembered. After the lion was hit, one of the lionesses jumped into the
water and swam for the steamer. She was killed alongside."</p>

<p>"And the other lioness?"</p>

<p>"I regret to state she turned tail. I have always supposed she had cubs
at home."</p>

<p>"Hello!" cried Tom, "what's that? Some one firing on shore. Look!"</p>

<p>Mr. Jollytarre used his field-glass. The Captain of the <i>Blosse Lynch</i>
sauntered up with his glass. On the banks of the river were two men
firing at each other, one on either side, using the steamer apparently
as a screen.</p>

<p>"Some of my crew tell me that those are two brothers," said the Captain,
"who are fighting for the supremacy of their tribe. They keep up with us
pretty well, don't they? Now look at that rascal shooting at that other
fellow across the bow of the boat. By Jove! he's hit him. The man's
down. Two or three men are running up to him and carrying him off. It's
a dangerous country," continued the Captain, "and a bad lot of tribes
all along here. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[Pg 732]</a></span> are always giving trouble, robbing grain and cargo
boats at every opportunity."</p>

<p>Every ten or twenty miles the vessel would steam by an Arab settlement,
or rather encampment, where nothing could be ruder than the huts built
of mats and reeds.</p>

<p>The Arab boys of these villages would run along the banks shouting to
the passengers, who would throw them apples and onions and cabbages. The
sight of this sport fascinated Tom, who first begged a cabbage of the
steward, and then hurled it toward the shore. It fell midway, however,
into the water, whereupon the boys set up a shout of baffled
expectation. But in the next moment two or three of them had sprung in
after the precious gift, swimming fearlessly, regardless of the swift
current and the wash of the steamer.</p>

<p>"The grown-ups are at it now," cried Mr. Jollytarre. "Look, Tom, look!"</p>

<p>As he spoke three men and a woman plunged into the river and exerted all
their energies to seize upon a handful of onions which some of the crew
just then threw overboard. Loaded with their booty they swam ashore
satisfied.</p>

<p>As they proceeded on their way the aspect of the country improved
greatly. Little towns built of sun-dried bricks replaced the former
villages of reeds and mats. Among the dwellers on the Upper Tigris are
Bedouins who had wandered thither in the dry season to water their
flocks, and had settled there.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_009.jpg" width="500" height="209" alt="" />
<span class="caption">A PARTY OF WANDERING BEDOUINS.</span>
</div>

<p>Have you all heard of the Bedouins of the desert? At certain seasons the
desert is an arid waste, where flocks would perish of thirst. Many
Bedouins, who had thus found their way to the river-banks, and had staid
on, became farmers there. Some of them in the course of time would
wander off to Bagdad or some other great town in search of employment,
and thus these wanderers would cease to be the Bedouins of the desert.</p>

<p>Tom became thoroughly interested in all this. He looked with curiosity
at the farmer Bedouins. Presently he saw a party of them mounted upon
camels ("ships of the desert") steering their way along the river-bank.</p>

<p>"There's one queer thing," Tom said, looking about him on the steamer's
deck. "Did you ever see so many blind people together before, Mr.
Jollytarre? I mean blind of one eye. I never saw anything like it. What
do you suppose is the cause?"</p>

<p>"Diseases of the eye are very common here on account, I suppose, of the
glare of the sun on these hot plains. They have a way of using tobacco
juice as a remedy for these diseases, which only makes them worse. The
native doctors put out many an eye by this treatment. The patient is
lucky if he escapes with even one good one. The natives have great
confidence in the European doctors, and look upon them as
magicians&mdash;that is, unless they propose to cut off an arm or a leg. That
they won't submit to; they would rather die. The loss of an eye is
evidently a trifling matter."</p>

<p>"That accounts for the Three Calenders," said Tom, "You remember those
Three Calenders in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>? They were princes' sons, each
blind of the right eye, who all met at the gates of Bagdad together. Now
I've always thought it so very remarkable&mdash;all three blind of the same
eye, all three princes, all meeting at the same place."</p>

<p>"What you might call a coincidence, or rather three of them. I always
used to think that story hard to swallow myself, but since I've seen
these Eastern folks in the flesh, I find it easier to believe. In fact,
I have been told that it would be a very singular circumstance if three
individuals came together at Bagdad, or any other town in the
neighborhood, who could count six eyes among them."</p>

<p>So they went on their way, coming nearer and nearer to Bagdad. Five
hours from their destination they came to the ruins of two cities, the
"Twin Cities of the Arabs"&mdash;Seleucia and Ctesiphon.</p>

<p>Seleucia was built on the western bank of the Tigris, by Seleucus, one
of Alexander's generals. After the death of Alexander his vast empire
was divided between four of his generals, and the grand division called
Syria fell to the share of Seleucus. This included part of ancient
Assyria, and therefore the venerable city of Babylon, which was at one
time the greatest city in the world. As Seleucia rose into power it
gradually took the place of Babylon, which fell into decay in its turn.</p>

<p>Ctesiphon was built opposite Seleucia on the other bank, and was the
capital of the Parthian Empire, its royal palace being one of the
wonders of the ancient world.</p>

<p>Kingdoms were bowled up and down in those days just as they are now, and
in this way Ctesiphon was sacked by the Arabs, when, a few years after
the death of Mohammed, they prostrated the Persian kingdom.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/ill_010.jpg" width="400" height="389" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"CSAR'S ARCH" AT CTESIPHON.</span>
</div>

<p>The wonderful royal palace was destroyed and its glories scattered. One
marvellous carpet in particular, which covered the Hall of Audience, was
sent to the Caliph Omar as a trophy worthy of him alone. He had it cut
up and divided among the captors, and it was of course ruined.</p>

<p>Tom and Mr. Jollytarre wandered through the ruins of Ctesiphon, talking
of these things.</p>

<p>"At one time," said Mr. Jollytarre, "they were rebuilding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">[Pg 733]</a></span> or rather
refounding, Bagdad, in the time of a caliph called Almansur. He
determined to use the devastated palace of Ctesiphon as a quarry for
materials. He ordered the famous building to be entirely demolished for
this purpose; but it was found to be impossible to carry out his orders,
the pile was so stupendous. There is 'Csar's Arch,' for instance, which
has escaped the destroyer's hand. The height and span of this arch are
said to be unequalled in the world."</p>

<p>But Tom heaved a sigh. "I should have liked to see that carpet," he
said.</p>

<p>"Yes, so should I. I hardly think carpet-makers of the East have
improved since that day. They improve slowly out here. I don't believe
things have altered much since Alexander's day."</p>

<p>"Those round boats, for instance," said Tom.</p>

<p>"So much for the 'Twin Cities of the Arabs,'" said the Lieutenant, as
they embarked once more on the <i>Blosse Lynch</i>. "Tom, I wonder your small
head does not burst with all the sights you have seen and the wonders
you have heard since we left Bassorah."</p>

<p>"Most of it goes in one ear and out the other," replied Tom, frankly.</p>

<p>At night-fall of the third day they reached Bagdad, but it was too late
to go on shore.</p>

<p>Two little cousins were going to school the other day, and as they
passed my window I watched their faces. One of the boys, whose name was
Harold, looked very happy. I was as sure as though he had told me so
that he had been helped by a pair of twin fairies who are always very
busy at this time of the year. The two little creatures flit from one
school-room to another, and the boys and girls whom they assist may be
known by several signs. They hold their heads up bravely, they walk with
light steps, and they are never seen to frown or pout. I was sure by
Harold's eyes that he and the fairies I mean were close friends.</p>

<p>Edgar, the other boy, went to school with an air which gave me pain. I
was not at all surprised to hear him say that he had a cross teacher,
and that he did not like his lessons, and could not learn them. Poor
fellow! A naughty fairy had captured him, and I put on my spectacles and
took my knitting while I thought of a plan to set him free from her
power.</p>

<p>The fairies who help children at school are bright-eyed creatures, who
teach you two things&mdash;the first is how to hold fast, the second is how
to hold on. Fairy Holdfast will not let her friends look at a half-dozen
things at once. She says, "Now, my boys and girls, ten times one is ten.
Think of that, and of nothing else. Look, straight at the teacher if in
the class-room; look straight at the book if it is study hour. I will
hover about, and keep everybody who wants to bother you out of sight."</p>

<p>Fairy Holdon says, sweetly, "Dear little ones, Rome was not built in a
day. One brick at a time, and the house is completed. One day at a time,
and the century is finished. One lesson at a time, perfectly learned,
and the little boy becomes a great scholar."</p>

<p>Some people call the Fairy Holdfast Attention, and the Fairy Holdon
Diligence, but I think the other names are prettier and much easier to
remember, don't you?</p>

<p>As for the wicked fairy who is the foe of all good boys and girls, her
name is Fairy Scatterbrain, though some people call her Idleness. She is
not nearly so strong as the kind fairies I have been talking about, and
if you make an effort to snap the threads she weaves about you, they
will break like spiders' webs. Only, <i>you</i> must make the effort. Nobody
can do it for you.</p>

<p>I intend to whisper this secret to Edgar on the first opportunity.</p>

this place. We left Apache early on the morning of June 28, and
arrived here on the afternoon of July 9, having travelled in an
ambulance drawn by six stout mules. The road was very rough in some
places, but the scenery was beautiful, especially when crossing the
mountains. We passed by the graves of the men killed by Indians
last May. In one grave there were five bodies. We also saw the
charred remains of a wagon, to which the Indians had tied men and
then burned them. We had a detail of sixteen soldiers, or we should
have been very much afraid. We camped each night, and I thought how
surprised Eastern people would have been had they seen us sitting
outside the tents after supper, singing, in this wild country. I'll
write again some time, and tell about this funny little fort&mdash;that

that I thought I would like to write you one. I have two dogs:
their names are Prince and Gip. Prince is a shepherd dog, but can
not scent so well as Gip, who is a rat terrier; so Prince coaxes
Gip to go rabbit-hunting with him, and scent and catch the rabbits,
when Prince eats them. Gip does not always like to do the work and
let Prince have all the enjoyment, and sometimes runs back after
they get started, but Prince will rub his nose, pat, and coax until
Gip will finally go. I have two ducks, and they sit on nests close
together, and divide the eggs between them. I have also a cat named
Bessie; she had a kitten, but it died. I have a little sister named
"Tot." I have taken <span class="smcap">Harper's Young People</span> ever since it first
started, and I think "Toby Tyler" was the best story of all. I am
in the country visiting, and my auntie is writing this letter for
me, as I am only six years old, and can not write. I have been
riding on horseback, chasing the cows and pigs, catching chickens
for auntie, drinking all the milk I want, and having a real good
time. I have not seen any letters from the Knoxville girls and
boys; so I hope you will print this, and let me surprise my papa,
who prints papers too.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a very nice letter, only, dear Sterling, I am sorry those dogs
hunt and eat the poor rabbits, and if I were their little master, I
would stop such work if I could. The ducks are much kinder than the
dogs, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Will you publish a letter from a little girl who lives away off on
the Pacific coast, where no one is ever advised to "go West"? I am
six years old. Papa subscribed for the <span class="smcap">Young People</span> last winter,
and it was so long coming that we began to fear that the money had
been lost, when at last four numbers came all at once, and on my
birthday at that. We live at the mouth of Rogue River. There is a
large salmon cannery here, and a great many men are employed during
the fishing season. A long time ago this place was called Gold
Beach, on account of the very rich mines here. Sometimes we walk on
the beach and gather moss and shells. From the front door we can
see steamers passing up and down the coast, and can watch the
fishing-boats. Last summer papa took me to San Francisco, and I
enjoyed the trip very much. I have two brothers, Bertie and Harry,
and a sister Pearl, and I am the oldest of them all. I have a
number of dolls, and a kitten named Jessie. Bertie's kitten is
named Daisy. We all think ever so much of <span class="smcap">Young People</span>. I have a
little friend named Clarence, who is going to subscribe. I can not
read much myself, but mamma reads to us. Mamma is writing at my
dictation, but she says we must "boil it down," or you will not
even read my letter. I think that of all the subscribers in the
United States, none live so far West as your little Oregonian

<p>We think the following letter from a lad of twelve will interest many
other wide-awake boys who have never had the pleasure of seeing what
goes on in a navy-yard. We will be pleased to hear from our young
correspondent again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I live in the Boston Navy-Yard. I thought it would be interesting
to the readers of <span class="smcap">Harper's Young People</span> to hear something in regard
to navy-yards in general. I have lived in two yards, and have
visited several others. I think the Boston Navy-Yard by far the
most interesting. In it is a rope factory which is 1300 feet long.
All kinds of rope are made here. It is not only interesting but
instructive to watch the process. First the hemp is combed and
twisted into strands, then these strands are twisted into sections
of rope, then three or four sections are twisted together to form a
complete rope. Wire rope is also made here, which is used for
stationary rigging. A manila rope was on exhibition at the
Centennial which was made in this yard, the circumference of which
was 28 inches; this was the largest rope ever made. The dry-dock is
another very interesting feature of this yard. It is a place where
ships float in for repairs. After they are in, gates are closed,
and the water pumped out by a powerful steam-pump, leaving the ship
high and dry, so that even her bottom can be repaired without the
aid of divers. The dimensions of this dry-dock are 403 feet long,
99 feet wide, and 32 feet deep. It was begun July 10, 1827, and
opened June 24, 1833, and cost $677,000.</p></blockquote>

<p>I want to tell you about our nurse's wedding, and I want you to put
my letter in your dear little paper; but before I begin I must tell
you that we live away out in the country in Alabama. We moved here
from Augusta two years ago. Papa has an iron furnace here. There
are about two hundred cabins all around the furnace. Our house is
called the "Big House"; it stands off by itself.</p>

<p>Well, when Cinda (that is nurse's name) told mamma she was going to
be married, mamma gave her lots of nice things for a wedding
supper, and told Cinda she could be married on our big piazza.
Cinda was so happy, and was not cross a bit that day, and when she
bathed us did not get a bit of soap in our eyes.</p>

<p>Cinda is nearly forty years old, and mamma says her name is most
appropriate (for she is as black as a cinder). Her husband "to be"
was ten years younger than she, but he did not seem to mind that,
for he had been begging Cinda a long time to marry him. When the
hour came, mamma and some lady visitors went to the piazza. The
friends of the bride and groom were there too. Then Cinda and
Albert came on the piazza.</p>

<p>Cinda wore a black cashmere dress and white gloves, and flowers in
her hair and at her neck. We children thought she looked so nicely.
When Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; asked Albert if he took Cinda to be his wife, and
would protect and support her, Albert just hollered out, "You bet I
will, boss"; and then Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; said they were "man and wife." Then
they went to one of the cabins, and had their supper and a nice
time.</p></blockquote>

<p>About two months ago I went to Los Angeles. There were seventeen in
the party, and we had a very nice time. I should like to tell you
about all we saw and did, but as that would take all the room in
the Post-office Box, I will just tell you about something I saw in
Los Angeles. We visited an old Hungarian, whose business was
training mocking-birds and raising flowers for market. He had about
one hundred large birds, and in a box by themselves a dozen or more
young birds. He placed their food on the end of a stick, and put it
through the wires of the cages, and each one would stretch out his
wings to keep the others away while eating it. When he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">[Pg 735]</a></span> to the
little ones, they all opened their mouths, and then they did look
funny enough, for their throats are bright yellow, and one could
see little except mouths. He teaches them to whistle tunes very
sweetly. When they can not learn to sing, he turns them out; but
they stay near by, and he feeds them. There was one bird near our
camp that sang all night. The man had eleven dogs, and bought two
sacks of flour and two dollars' worth of meat a month for them. He
said he loved birds, dogs, and flowers better than human beings. We
were gone from home two weeks, and saw a great deal of Southern
California.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">A curious Chinese Custom</span>.&mdash;The people who live in the southern part of
China are said to observe, once a year, a festival to which all look
forward almost as eagerly as Americans do to the Fourth of July. It is
called the Filial Porridge festival. Instead of boiling rice by itself
on that day, sugar, seeds, fruit, dried dates, and other things are
cooked with the rice, making a dish which is almost black in color and
very thick. This porridge is placed in bowls, and is set before the
ancestral tablets and household gods which one finds in every Chinese
house. Here it is left for a time, with incense and candles burning
beside it. After a while, when the souls of the departed ancestors are
supposed to have consumed all they wish, the family are at liberty to
eat the remainder. Children who are married, and away from home, make
and send a dish of this porridge to their parents if they possibly can.
After the filial porridge has been eaten, the boys and girls amuse
themselves by firing off crackers, playing merry games, and having a
pleasant time.</p>

<p>This is a pretty story about a terrier, is it not? A hungry boy called
at a house in Rochester, and asked for something to eat. He was told
that there was nothing, but he pleaded with the servant, saying, "Give
me only a piece of bread."</p>

<p>The dog, who had been standing by the domestic, suddenly ran away, and
in a moment returned, carrying in her mouth a large piece of bread,
which had been given to her for her breakfast. Going straight to the
boy, she laid it down at his feet, looking up at him, and motioning with
her head and paws, as if to bid him take it.</p>

<p>Du Chaillu, in his beautiful stories of travel in Scandinavia related in

country by young girls. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At every station I had a young girl for a driver, and these
children of the North seemed not in the least afraid of me. My
first driver's name was Ida Catharina. She gave me a silver ring,
and was delighted when she saw it on my finger. I promised to bring
her a gold one the following winter, and I kept my word. She was
glad indeed when, at the end of the drive, I gave her a silver
piece. Another driver, twelve years old, was named Ida Carolina.
The tire of one of our wheels became loose, but she was equal to
the emergency. She alighted, blocked the wheel with a stone, went
to a farm-house and borrowed a few nails and a hammer, and with the
help of a farmer, made everything right in a few minutes. She did
not seem in the least put out by the accident. She chatted with me
all the time though I did not then understand what she said, for I
did not then know the Finnish language. She was a little beauty,
with large blue eyes, thick fair hair, and rosy cheeks. From early
life children are here taught to depend upon themselves."</p></blockquote>

<span class="caption">"A LITTLE TOO MUCH FISH."</span>
</div>

<h2>"MY SHARK."</h2>

<h3>BY EESUNG EYLISS.</h3>

<p>The experience of this comical youth who is struggling so valiantly with
"A little too much fish" reminds me of my adventure with the finny
monster that I always call "my shark."</p>

<p>"Hold on to him, I say. Don't let him get the better of you. Hold him
tight. There, you have let him run again."</p>

<p>It was the minister who spoke; but I paid little heed to his advice, for
at that moment I was busy&mdash;very busy; and not only that, but I was
satisfied that the present business I understood better than my adviser.</p>

<p>The way of it was this. We were in Gardiner's Bay; had gone down to fish
for porgees chiefly, though, of course, taking whatever came to hand. It
was my custom to take with me on such occasions a shark line, and not
unfrequently I had fine sport in that way. This day, of which I have
been speaking, I had invited the pastor of the village church to
accompany me, and with him had come a theological student who was
visiting at his house.</p>

<p>We had a delightful sail down the bay, and commenced our fishing. The
first porgee which I caught, I rapped on the head, and then putting him
on my shark hook as bait I paid out the line (a half-inch rope to which
the hook was attached) until it had run off with the tide about fifty
feet astern of us, and resumed my fishing.</p>

<p>Our success was good, and we were enjoying it finely when r-a-s-p,
r-a-s-p I heard my heavy shark line dragging out over the gunnel of the
boat. I knew the sound well, and what it meant; a shark was going off
with my baited porgee.</p>

<p>I caught the rope, gave it a quick and strong pull to hook him, and
found at once that I had my hands full. I had taken many of them, and I
knew on the instant, from the violent strain, that he was one of more
than common size. He had not as yet become much alarmed, and he was
simply swimming off with determination, but without any special
excitement. We were in a large sail-boat, but he was swinging us in the
tideway as though it was only a floating board. All this time I was
gathering in the line, until I brought him up where I could see him; I
judged him to be eight feet long at least.</p>

<p>When he came thus near the surface, he took fright and turned down. Of
course I could not hold him, and he dragged the rope through my hands
foot after foot, until he was nearly a hundred feet away. I made out to
glance over my shoulder in search of my crew. I found that the party
were mustered forward holding tight to the mast, and looking decidedly
solemn. I could not, however, attend to them, but proceeded to gather in
my shark again.</p>

<p>By the time that, after a heavy struggle, I had once more brought him to
close quarters, he had become somewhat tired out, and dragging his head
to the surface I dealt him a blow with a club. And it was as I took up
the club that the parson volunteered his advice, as already mentioned.
The blow was not sufficient to stun the shark, and off like a runaway
horse he went again. But when I brought him up the third time it was
manifest that he was becoming exhausted, and that I could hold him. And
hereupon the pastor took heart of grace and came to the rescue.</p>

<p>"Hold him tight, now. Let me get at him; I want to pay him off for past
scores. The sins of the fathers descend upon the children, you know; and
I believe it was his grandfather that used to frighten me so when I
played truant from school and ran off to Fulton Market to bathe. I will
settle him," and, taking the club, he rapped the poor shark across the
brain until life was extinct, and I could, with the help of my crew,
haul him into the boat. He was a little less than nine feet long, and
his name is Eugomphodus littoralis. He has long, slender teeth, almost
like horseshoe nails, each tooth having a sharp point on each side near
the base. He is the only shark of our coast with such teeth. The species
is found from Cape Cod to Hatteras.</p>

<h3>ALLITERATION.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h3>

<p>Although this game requires close attention, it is much less difficult
than it appears, for very young players succeed well in it after a
little practice. The players are arranged in a circle, and to each a
letter of the alphabet is assigned in order, from which he must produce
a sentence every word of which begins with his letter.</p>

<p>At the expiration of ten minutes each one must read or say his line, in
the order in which the players are seated. As it is harder to compose
these sentences mentally than to write them, the manner of playing must
be decided beforehand. The former way is better, even if the lines are
shorter or less finished, as memory as well as invention is thus
strengthened. A few examples are given below, which children can easily
follow to the end of the alphabet.</p>

<p>"An aristocratic artist angrily argued against an ancient art article,
anticipating all antagonistic announcements, and answering all sthetic
attacks."</p>

<p>"Busy bees brightly buzz by brilliant bowers, borrowing beneficent
burdens by burrowing brown bodies below beautiful bean blossoms."</p>

<p>"Careless censure continually condemning can cause careful candor
considerable consternation."</p>

<p>"Dainty deeds daily done dearly delight dutiful daughters."</p>

<p>"Each eager enthusiast exults every Easter, eagerly examining each
Easter-egg."</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
